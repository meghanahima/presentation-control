about libraries:-----------------------------------------
in cv zone the hand tracker module uses mediapipe library(detect hands, face, pose) to give handDetector functionality(hand detector functionality has findHands, fingersUp functions)

CV zone - simplifies computer vision tasks - open CV + media pipe

pywin32 has win32com.client (control powerpoint through com automation)

challenge for gestures:--------------------------------------
normal hand movements should not be recognised as the gestures, so a particular gesture threshold is used to solve this problem

voice capturing:---------------------------------------------
In Whisper, your audio waveform is converted into a tensor. tensor is given to model and it passes layer by layer to give final tensor which has text token probabilites which gives final transcription

i have used speech_recognition for capture audio and google speech API to get text from audio

i want one wake word and then the command will be listened - for this porcupine library is used because 
it will not constantly record and transcribe but detect for the wake word and only then the audio recorded with speech_recognition and transcribed with google speech API


challenge on ptt slide what is happening cannot be known - but in console i can see messages like waiting for wake word, say command, no wake word detected,.. of voice.py module-------------------------
so to solve this i am showing the same messages on bottom of the ppt slide using win32com.client

but there is still challenge that this cannot be done from voice.py because the win32com.client does not support background threads to do this task as it is not thread-safe
utilitized message queues and the messages being pushed into these and the message are displayed on the slide by main thread

this did not work well


to solve the issue of displaying message like captions ------------------------
I have used  overlay in main thread and created seperate threads for gesture and voice.
what i have done is if gesture recognized - i have called safe_slide_action by gesture thread and if voice command recognized, then i called safe_slide_action from voice thread which again did not work as the win32com client cannot be invoked by 2 threads, so from the main thread itseld these slide movements need to be done, so i am moving these commands into message queue and this queue will run the slide movements functions
solution title - build a thread-safe command queue
